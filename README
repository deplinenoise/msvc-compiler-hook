This is a hack to install a hook inside Visual Studio 2008 and intercept
CreateProcess calls and rewrite them. This allows you to rewrite the command
lines of compile and link steps, so you can mix Win32 and Amiga compilation in
the same project.

The way to do this is to look for some special command line parameter, like
/AMIGA and then totally rewrite the command line.

The second part to this is a controller that sits in your tray that enables the
hooking. The controller has the rewrite tables and does the actual command line
patching. This was much more convenient than having everything in one package.

This program should work, but is rough and untested and is made available as a
proof of concept.

To build it, download EasyHook and put all the DLLs and stuff it in the bin/
directory.
